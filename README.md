## Reason why they selected their topic

  We selected the topic of COVID-19, because we are currently in a situtation where there are still relatively high numbers of people with COVID-19.


## Description of their source of data

  The data consists of covid-testing specimens, the extracted date of the specimen results, the number of people tested, the number of people who were tested positive for COVID-19, the number of COVID-19 people who were hospitalized, as well as the number of people who passed away in the hospital due to COVID-19.


## Questions they hope to answer with the data

  Does the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized correlate with the average percentage of COVID-19 patients who passed away during hospitalization?
  
  By analyzing the data can we predict the trend of people testing positive in NYC?

  By analyzing the data from hospitalization and death rates compared to the tested positive for COVID-19, has the virus appeared to cause a more severe effect on the community?
  
  Did the time of vaccination correlate with the number of deaths in the hospital due to COVID-19?
