# Covid-19-
Group Project with Covid-19 Dataset

## Selected Topic

  COVID-19

## Reason why they selected their topic

  We selected the topic of COVID-19, because we are currently in a situtation where there are still relatively high numbers of people with COVID-19.


## Description of their source of data

  The data consists of covid-testing specimens, the extracted date of the specimen results, the number of people tested, the number of people who were tested positive for COVID-19, the number of COVID-19 people who were hospitalized, as well as the number of people who passed away in the hospital due to COVID-19.


## Questions they hope to answer with the data

  Does the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized correlate with the average percentage of COVID-19 patients who passed away during hospitalization?
